This project helps to generate initial Java project layout with the help of **Maven Archetypes**.

It is not required to have Maven 2 preinstalled - instead it uses [JLaunchPad](http://jlaunchpad.sourceforge.net) (as part of the installation). It means that required by **Maven** and **Maven Archetypes Plugin** parts will be downloaded and installed into your local repository automatically.

All you need to do is to specify the **location of Java** and the **location of Maven repository**. If you are working behind the firewall, you have to specify **proxy parameters** too.
